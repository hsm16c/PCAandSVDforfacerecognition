# PCAandSVDforfacerecognition
---
Welcome to the Face Recognition with PCA and SVD project! This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for face recognition using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques. By leveraging these advanced mathematical concepts, our system can learn from a database of facial images, add new faces to the database, and accurately recognize faces from new images.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Learning**: Our system employs PCA and SVD to extract meaningful features, such as eigenfaces, from a dataset of facial images. This allows for efficient dimensionality reduction and representation of facial data in a lower-dimensional space.
  
- **Dynamic Addition**: Easily expand your facial database by adding new images of individuals. Our system automatically updates the projection matrix to incorporate these new faces, ensuring continual improvement and adaptability.
  
- **Precise Recognition**: Utilizing the power of PCA and SVD, our system excels at recognizing faces with high accuracy, even in varying lighting conditions and facial expressions. It compares the projections of new images with those in the database to determine the closest match, enabling reliable face identification.
